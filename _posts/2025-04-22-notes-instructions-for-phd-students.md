I just read ["Instructions for PhD Students"](https://edisonchan-szu.github.io/Instructions_for_PhD_Students.pdf) by Dimitris Papadias (HKUST) and took notes to record and share insights with fellow PhD students—hope this helps.

**Top 3 Notes:**

1\. **Compete for your advisor’s attention.** Advisors always have infinite tasks to focus on; it's your responsibility to get their attention. Never feel guilty about actively seeking it.

2\. **Always write down (a) your ideas and (b) summaries of interesting readings.** Writing helps clarify your logic, generates new ideas, and ensures your advisor visibly recognizes your progress—otherwise, your effort may remain unnoticed.

3\. **Proactively request opportunities to present to your advisor.** Initiating these discussions is both your right and responsibility, crucial for receiving feedback.

**Presentation Advice (4-step flow):**

1\. Clearly define the problem first. Without a clear problem statement, everything else is meaningless. Problems matter more than solutions.

2\. Present related work.

3\. Present the abstract idea.

4\. Then dive into details.

**Extra tips:**

- If you can't explain it simply, you likely don't understand it fully. Learn thoroughly or skip that part of your presentation.
- Audience understanding is your responsibility—not theirs.
- Never assume your audience knows something; always provide complete logic.
- Papers get accepted based on the importance and innovation of problems, not merely solutions.

**Paper Advice:**

- Refine your paper at least 5 times. Read, refine, and repeat.

**Life Advice:**

- Never miss deadlines; start early and include buffer time.
- Acceptance builds your CV; rejection builds character.
- Don't crash under pressure—your emotions are your responsibility, not your colleagues'. It's perfectly acceptable to quit your PhD if necessary.
