I've been configuring a new operating system for so many times and every time I
reinstall a new OS I need to do exactly the sanme configuration, which is
\*\*\*\* stupid. I need an automatic script to help me with it, and it needs to
be awesome -- it contains my favorate configurations! You might find it useful,
too.

Currently I made it available on GitHub.
[ECS](https://github.com/Tr0py/Environment-Config-Script).

It includes 

1. Installing basic utilities: vim, build-essentials, tmux, ...
2. Configuration for common tools using my favorate configs: oh-my-zsh, tmux.conf, .vimrc,
   ...

Enjoy!:)
